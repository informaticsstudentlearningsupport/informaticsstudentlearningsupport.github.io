# What is InfPALS


InfPALS is a Peer support for 1st year Informatics students. Instead of covering the regular courses as it does [InfBase](infbase.html), InfPALS focuses on anything else that you might want to catch up with. InfPALS is also run in sessions and covers, e.g., : 

* 


As a group of 2nd and 3rd year students we will guide you through difficulties with course material and help you apply your knowledge in new situations to strengthen your understanding. Together we will ease your transition into your new-found university life!


<!-- ## What We Do
We have worked on activities relating to some of the core concepts of first year computer science, such as finite state automata, resolution, higher order functions and more. Together with the students we have developed techniques to practice these concepts effectively for exams and future years. We have introduced peer learning into the student body as a mean to cope with university-related workload better together!

## How Does InfPALS work?

* You will be grouped into small study groups of 10-15 students for two InfPALS Leaders based on shared interests and courses. 
* Ideally, you stay in these groups during the whole semester.
* You don't have to join all sessions but can use the group to connect beyond the InfPALS sessions
* Each group will have a Microsoft Teams channel over which you will be able to chat, ask questions and meet fellow first-years, as well as your higher-year Leaders.
* You will be meeting with your group virtually on a weekly basis to go through activities on the core topics of your Informatics courses or anything that you might wish to go over for clarity â€“ it isnâ€™t a tutorial and your input will shape what the meetingsâ€™ content will be.
* A small study group will make it easier for you to engage, get to know other students personally rather than through large impersonal group chats, and ask questions about virtually anything in a much more informal setting.
