# Tutor FAQ


This page lists general queations about being a tutor.

## How can I become a tutor? 

We will send out a recruitment email, usually around welcome week of the new academic year (mid September). Tutors are usually recruited for both Semester 1 and 2 but if we encounter empty places, we will re-recruit early January. 


## How many hours should I list on my weekly time sheet? 

On your weekly time sheet, you only need to indicate the hours you have spend in a session. Currently, every tutor is running 2h a week. ITO will add 2h preparation to these 2h and you will get paid 4h per week. 

If you have worked more then 2 session hours a week (or less), e.g., by taking over someone else's hours, you add those to your 2h. 


## When will I get paid? 

You will get paid the month after you have submitted the timesheet, i.e. you have until 28th Oct to fill the hours you worked in October, but will get paid for those on 28th November.
