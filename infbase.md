# What is InfBase

InfBase is a drop-in helpdesk for year-1 and year-2 students to get additional tutoring and support with their courses.

InfBase is run by students in higher years with of expertise and who offer 1-on-1 support and advice on core pre-honours courses in Informatics. In addition to supporting drop-in assistance, InfBase can be used as a place to work together with other students, with support from an InfBase tutor.

Due to persisting social distancing measures, InfBase will run online during semester 1 and very likely will remain online during semester 2.

## Join an InfBase Session

InfBase will run on its dedicated Teams team. The channel is public to all students and you find the drop-in sessions in the General channel. Just join the call during the sessions times. During the sessions times—see schedule below—a tutor will be around to help you with your questions. Questions may be answered publicly. If you do not wish to speak up, it’s OK to type your question into the chat. 

Since this is the first time we’re running InfBase online, we are exploring ways to support you as best as we can and may adapt new ways to run InfBase during the course of the semester. If you have specific suggestions how to improve InfBase online, please let your tutors know.

If you wish to create an online study group, you can create dedicated channels in the InfBase team for your chats and calls. If a tutor is available, you may ask them to join your learning group.

## Schedule

Regular InfBase sessions start in Week 3 and run until including the revision week. Each session runs for 1 hours (e.g., Monday 9-10), supported by a tutor (last row). Not all sessions can cover all courses. The detailed schedule for all InfBase sessions and supported courses will appear on this website in week 2.
