# Informatics Student Learning Support

This the webpage of the Informatics Student Learning Support at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh. There are several schemes the School is running to support its students beyond the regular courses. 

__This website is under heavy development at the beginning of the semester to get all the information online as we obtain them. Come back to check for regular updates.__
