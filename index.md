# Informatics Student Learning Support

This the webpage of the Informatics Student Learning Support at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh. There are several schemes the School is running to support its students beyond the regular courses. 

__This website is under heavy development at the beginning of the semester to get all the information online as we obtain them. Come back to check for regular updates.__

* [InfBase](infbase.html) is a drop-in helpdesk for year-1 and year-2 students to get additional tutoring and support with their courses. InfBase starts in week 3 of each semester. 
* [InfPALS](infpals/infpals.html) is a peer support for 1st year Informatics students including topics around courses but also general topics related to informatics. InfPALS starts in week 3 of each semester.
* [CompSoc](https://comp-soc.com/) is a tech society, organizing talks, workshops, and plenty of socials. Find out more.
* [Programming Club](http://progclub.inf.ed.ac.uk/) is for undergraduate students to get more practical programming experience. It is held once a week during term time. For a couple of hours in a relaxed lab students have the chance to work on different challenges, play with some cool toys and engage with fun programming projects. Programming Club will start in week 2.
